          Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried
          rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.

          Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously
          tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.
